Introduction
Deepfake technology has gained significant attention due to its potential for misuse and dissemination of fake content. The objective of this project is to build a deepfake detection system that can effectively identify manipulated videos and images. The system utilizes a combination of CNN, LSTM, and Transformers, and integrates with Flask to provide a user-friendly web interface.

Prerequisites
Before getting started with the deepfake detection project, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

1. Python(3.7 or higher).
2. Tensorflow
3. Cmake
4. Flask

Installation
Follow the steps below to install and set up the deepfake detection project:

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/JiteshNayak2004/router_placement.git

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   python3 -m venv env

3. Install the required dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
